<h2 id="p1">1: Uses of corn</h2>
    <p>Corn, also known as maize, is one of the most versatile and widely used crops in the world. It serves as a staple food for millions of people, consumed in various forms such as cornmeal, popcorn, tortillas, and cornflakes. Beyond direct human consumption, corn is a major source of animal feed, providing essential nutrients for livestock like cattle, pigs, and poultry. Industrially, corn is processed into a range of products, including corn syrup, cornstarch, ethanol fuel, and biodegradable plastics. Additionally, corn oil is commonly used for cooking and in processed foods. Because of its adaptability and diverse applications, corn plays a vital role in global agriculture, industry, and food security.

    <h2 id="p2">2: Types of corn </h2>
       <p>There are several main types of corn, each grown for specific purposes. Dent corn, also called field corn, is the most common type and is mainly used for animal feed, industrial products, and processed foods. Flint corn, known for its hard outer layer, is often used in Latin American dishes and for decorative purposes. Sweet corn is the variety most people eat as a vegetable; it’s harvested while the kernels are tender and sweet. Popcorn is a special type of flint corn with kernels that expand and pop when heated. Flour corn has soft starch-filled kernels, making it ideal for cornmeal and baked goods. Each type of corn plays a unique role in agriculture, cuisine, and industry.

        <h2 id="p3">3: Recipes</h2>
        <p>Corn can be used in many tasty and simple recipes. Creamed corn is made by cooking corn kernels with butter, milk, and onions until smooth and creamy, creating a comforting side dish. Mexican street corn (elote) is grilled corn on the cob coated with mayonnaise, cheese, chili powder, and lime juice for a smoky, tangy flavor. Corn fritters combine corn with flour, eggs, and seasonings, then are fried until golden and crispy—perfect as a snack or appetizer. A fresh corn salad mixes corn with chopped vegetables, herbs, olive oil, and lime juice for a light, colorful dish. Each recipe highlights corn’s natural sweetness and versatility.</p>
        
        <h2 id="p4">4: Origin of corn</h2>
        <p>Corn, or maize, originated thousands of years ago in southern Mexico, where it was first domesticated by Indigenous peoples from a wild grass called *teosinte*. Through careful cultivation and selective breeding, early farmers transformed the small, hard kernels of teosinte into the larger, softer kernels of modern corn. Over time, corn became a staple crop across the Americas, spreading north and south through trade and migration. It played a central role in the cultures and diets of civilizations such as the Maya, Aztec, and Inca. After European explorers arrived in the Americas, corn was carried to Europe, Africa, and Asia, eventually becoming one of the world’s most important food crops.
